- web ui shows scoreboard and activity feed

### components

- web: web app shows scoreboard, activity feed, rules, etc

### architecture
- db: redis
- auth: slack oauth
- engine: serverless binary compiled from ocaml
- bot: node.js thin client queues (bee-queue) incoming messages and pipes them to engine over stdin
- web: next.js 13 project uses app router
